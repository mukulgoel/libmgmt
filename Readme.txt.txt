This is a VB.net based prototype implementation of a library management system. 

Submitted in defense of acceptance of internship in pre final year of Degree Computer sciences engineering

this is developed in vb.net, not sure why i choose this language in first place. 

But the implementation did turn out to be quite extra ordinary that i expected from myself. 


It is a GUI based, windows application software, that can handle basic functionalities like adding a book/customer, issuing a book, calculating fine etc.

and yea, the DB is a simple Access DB
